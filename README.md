Adds Piraeus Bank paycenter as a payment Gateway for WooCommerce

== Important Notice == 

This plugin is compatible with the change in the way that the ”Hash Key” is generated by Piraeus Bank.

== Description ==
This plugin adds Piraeus Bank paycenter as a payment gateway for WooCommerce. A contract between you and the Bank must be previously signed. Based on original plugin "Piraeus Bank Greece Payment Gateway for WooCommerce" by emspace.gr [https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-payment-gateway-piraeus-bank-greece/] and 
 on "Piraeus Bank WooCommerce Payment Gateway" by enartia [https://el.wordpress.org/plugins/woo-payment-gateway-for-piraeus-bank/]
It uses the redirect method, and SSL is not required.

The main diferrences from the original versions that lead to a creation of a new plugin, rather than improving those in existance are:
* The code has been rewritten and altered significally to implement an object oriented approach and rich commenting has been added
* It is compatible with the Polylang plugin. This allows a smooth integration with multilingual websites. Moreover, based on the language the visitor chooses to view the checkout page, it presents the same language on Piraeus Bank website. Currently supported languages greek, english
* Transaction Responses are now stored as custom post types and are easily accessible from the dashoboard. This makes the communication with the bank easy in case an error occurs with the completion of a transaction
* It uses SESSIONS to store information instead of burdening the database
